## Description

`ai-lyrics` is a JavaScript library that allows you to easily fetch song lyrics from various sources on the web. It utilizes Puppeteer, a headless browser automation tool, to scrape lyrics from search results and provides methods to retrieve lyrics by song title or by both song title and artist.

## Installation

You can install `ai-lyrics` via npm:

```bash
npm install ai-lyrics
```

## Usage

```javascript
const LyricsAI = require('ai-lyrics');

(async function() {
    try {
        const songTitle = "Lily";
        const artist = "Alan Wlaker";
        //find with Title and Artist
        const lyricsByTitleAndArtist = await LyricsAI.findLyricsBySongTitleAndArtist(songTitle, artist);

        //find with just Title
        const lyricsByTitle = await LyricsAI.findLyricsBySongTitle(songTitle);
        console.log(`Find with Title and Artist ${lyricsByTitleAndArtist}`, `Find with Title ${lyricsByTitle}`);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error:", error);
    }
})();
```

Running this example will log the lyrics of the song "Lily" by Alan Walker.
```
Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then, she tried to run
...
Just let me in, ooh
```


## Notes

- Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- Please be aware of web scraping regulations and respect the terms of service of the websites from which you are scraping lyrics.
